## Hello, This is my Writeup for Emdee Five For Life Challenge From HackTheBox

There is many writeups about this challenge have already publiched

### Challenge Description

this challenge needs you to md5 the text which generated with each request fast enough so you can get the flag
so we can't do it without a script 

while all people solving it with requests and re modules in python  
i decided to just solve it with grep and curl in a 3 line bash script :laughing: 

### Code
